# Pokemon_cheat_sheet

Thanks for interest.

Because of cross-origin restriction I had some troubles to get data from Pokemon API. I found workaround but at the moment I know that it works on Chrome. If you would like to check the app on Safari, mind to disable cross-origin restrictions in browser settings.
Therfore, I reccomend using Chrome.

Cheers,
Iza
